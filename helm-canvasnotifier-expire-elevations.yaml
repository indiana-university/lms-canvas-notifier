# NOTE: The cron schedule here needs to be in UTC time (or whatever the TZ is on the kube controller), which is likely
# not the same as the local timezone.
# Example: If you want something to run at 2am Indiana time, as of October 27, you'd put a 6 for the hour.
# As of November 1, you'd put an 7 for the hour.
# EDT (March - November) = UTC -4
# EST (November - March) = UTC -5
